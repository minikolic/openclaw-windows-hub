# Versioning in OpenClaw Windows Hub

## How Versioning Works

This project uses GitVersion for automatic semantic versioning based on git tags and commit history. The version is used in multiple places:

### Version Properties in .csproj

The project files (`OpenClaw.Tray.csproj` and `OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI.csproj`) define only the `<Version>` property:

```xml
<Version>0.3.0</Version>
```

Other version-related properties (`FileVersion` and `AssemblyVersion`) are **not** explicitly set in the csproj files. This is intentional.

### Automatic Version Derivation

When only `<Version>` is set in a .NET project:
- **AssemblyVersion**: Automatically set to the numeric part of `Version` (e.g., `0.3.0` → `0.3.0.0`)
- **FileVersion**: Automatically set to the numeric part of `Version` (e.g., `0.3.0` → `0.3.0.0`)
- **InformationalVersion**: Set to the full `Version` value including suffixes (e.g., `0.3.0-beta.1`)

This ensures all version properties stay in sync automatically.

### CI Build Process

During CI builds (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), GitVersion determines the semantic version from git history and passes it to the build:

```bash
dotnet build -p:Version=${{ needs.test.outputs.semVer }}
```

This `-p:Version=...` argument overrides the `<Version>` property in the csproj, and consequently also sets `FileVersion` and `AssemblyVersion` to match.

### Auto-Updater Version Detection

The Updatum auto-updater determines the current application version by reading the **AssemblyVersion** from the running executable using:

```csharp
Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version
```

This is why it's critical that `AssemblyVersion` (and `FileVersion`) match the semantic version - otherwise, the updater will get confused and keep offering the same update repeatedly.

## Historical Issue

Previously, the csproj files had hardcoded values:

```xml
<Version>0.3.0</Version>
<FileVersion>0.2.0</FileVersion>
<AssemblyVersion>0.2.0</AssemblyVersion>
```

This caused a version mismatch:
- The semantic version was 0.3.0
- But the file and assembly versions were stuck at 0.2.0
- Updatum would read 0.2.0 from the running EXE
- It would see 0.4.0 available on GitHub
- It would offer to update from "0.2.0" to "0.4.0" even though the user was already on 0.3.0 or 0.4.0

## Solution

By removing the hardcoded `FileVersion` and `AssemblyVersion` properties, they now automatically derive from `Version`. When CI overrides `Version` via command-line, all three properties are set correctly and consistently.

## Best Practices

1. **Never hardcode `FileVersion` or `AssemblyVersion` in the csproj** - let them auto-derive from `Version`
2. **Let GitVersion and CI control the version** - the csproj's `<Version>` is just a fallback for local development builds
3. **Test version detection** - after building, check the EXE properties to ensure FileVersion matches expectations
4. **Use semantic versioning** - tags should follow `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` format (e.g., `v0.4.0`)
